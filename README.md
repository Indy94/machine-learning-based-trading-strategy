Instructions for Running the Code
Python Version: Ensure that you are using Python 3.12.3 on a JupyterHub notebook.
API KEY: Need a API key from https://cryptocompare.com/ it is free
Execution Order: Execute the code cells sequentially from top to bottom.
Hyperparameters: The hyperparameters have been commented out to save on computational resources. Compiling these settings took approximately 10 minutes on my machine. Optimal parameters for the machine learning model have already been determined and used in the code.
Data Gathering: An API is utilised for data collection. Please note:
Date Variance: The execution date of this code may differ from the date it was last executed for the included results. This discrepancy can lead to minor differences in the data but should not impact the overall outcome of the code.
Additional Information
It is essential to maintain the execution environment as described to ensure the code runs without issues. The outcomes, while consistent with the parameters and methods applied, may slightly vary with substantial changes in market conditions or data updates from the API.
